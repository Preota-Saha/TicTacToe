## 📝 **Introduction**

### **Background:**
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game commonly used as an introductory project in computer science and software development. Due to its straightforward rules and strategic depth, the game is ideal for learning AI algorithms, game logic, and decision-making. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, user interface design, and algorithmic problem-solving using Java technology.

### **Problem Statement:**
Traditional Tic-Tac-Toe implementations often lack advanced features such as efficient state management and a user-friendly interface. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a well-structured codebase, efficient logic, and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

### **Objectives:**
- Develop a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game adhering to standard rules for two players.
- Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modular and maintainable code.
- Create an interactive and visually appealing user interface using Java Swing.
- Optimize game state management, real-time input validation, and win condition detection.

### **Scope:**
The scope of this project is to deliver a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience. The game features a standard 3x3 grid where two players alternately place their marks until one player achieves a winning combination or the game ends in a draw. Key functionalities include:
- Real-time win detection
- Input validation
- Visual feedback for winners and ties

## ❗ **Gameplay Instructions**
1. Launch the game to see the main game window.
2. Two players take turns clicking on any empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
3. The game detects a win or tie in real time and displays the result.
4. The winning cells are highlighted in red and black background, and a tie is indicated with green marks with black background.
5. Close the window to exit the game.
